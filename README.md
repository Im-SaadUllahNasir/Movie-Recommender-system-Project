# Movie Recommender System

This is a Movie Recommender System built using machine learning techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences. The system leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Overview

The Movie Recommender System helps users discover new movies based on their past ratings or similar users' ratings. It can be used to recommend movies for a single user or for a group of users. The system can be extended or modified with different types of recommendation algorithms, such as:

- **Collaborative Filtering** (User-User or Item-Item)
- **Content-Based Filtering** (using movie features like genre, director, cast, etc.)
- **Hybrid Models** (combining both methods)

This project is intended to showcase how recommendation systems work and can be used to build personalized movie suggestion engines.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Based on users' past ratings and preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies with similar features.
- **Hybrid Filtering:** Combines collaborative and content-based methods for more accurate recommendations.
- **Interactive Interface:** A simple command-line interface (CLI) for user input and recommendations.
- **Dataset Integration:** Uses publicly available datasets such as [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) or custom datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (for the core implementation)
- **pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **numpy** (for numerical operations)
- **scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms)
- **surprise** (for building collaborative filtering models)
- **matplotlib** / **seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Flask** or **Streamlit** (optional for web app development)

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender.git
    cd movie-recommender
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *`requirements.txt` contains the list of necessary Python libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, surprise, etc.*

4. **Download dataset**:
   - You can either use the built-in sample dataset or download a dataset like [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Recommendation Engine**:
   
   To run the movie recommender with default settings:

   ```bash
   python recommender.py
   ```

   You will be prompted to enter user ratings or select a recommendation method.

2. **Recommender Modes**:
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: This method suggests movies based on similar users' preferences.
   - **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies based on similar features (e.g., genre, director).
   - **Hybrid**: Combines both techniques for better results.
